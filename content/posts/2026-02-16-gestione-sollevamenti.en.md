In this update, we introduce a completely new module for the Digital Safety platform, designed to simplify and centralize the management of lifting equipment.

## 🏗️ New Module: Lifts Management

The big news of this release is the **Lifts Management** module. This tool fills an important gap, offering dedicated features for the control and maintenance of cranes, hoists, and other lifting devices.

Key features include:

*   **Complete Product Registry**: A centralized digital archive for all your lifting equipment.
*   **Inspection and Repair Management**: Integrated tools to monitor deadlines, record inspection results, and manage maintenance interventions.
*   **Light License Integration**: Seamless data sharing (models and manufacturers) between different company locations and license levels.

## 🌍 International Expansion

We have made a significant step forward in the platform's internationalization. The new module has been launched with full support for 6 languages:

*   🇮🇹 Italian (it-it)
*   🇬🇧 English (en, en-us)
*   🇩🇰 Danish (da-dk)
*   🇩🇪 German (de-de)
*   🇪🇸 Spanish (es-es)
*   🇫🇷 French (fr-fr)
*   🇵🇹 Portuguese (pt-pt)
*   🇸🇪 Swedish (sv-se)

In addition to new translations, we have standardized technical terminology across all supported languages to ensure consistency and clarity.

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

Behind the scenes, we have optimized the code structure to ensure stability and performance:

*   **Backend Refactoring**: Implementation of new dedicated APIs for managing lift inspections and repairs.
*   **Frontend Optimization**: Improved side menu structure and route management for smoother navigation.
*   **Bug Fixes**: Resolved several display issues in tables and registers.
