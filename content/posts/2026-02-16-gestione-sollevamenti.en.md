In this update, we introduce an important new feature for the Digital Safety platform, focused on data integration and synchronization.

## 🏗️ New Module: Lifts Management

The **Lifts Management** module has been introduced with a specific goal: **to enable data synchronization with LIGHT licenses**.

This update is fundamental to ensure that information related to lifting equipment is perfectly aligned between the main license and LIGHT users.

### What does it allow you to do?

Thanks to this new functionality, it is now possible to synchronize to LIGHT licenses:

*   **Product Registry**: The complete and updated registry of devices.
*   **Inspection Status**: Visibility on results and deadlines of checks.
*   **Intervention History**: Details on recorded repairs and maintenance.

This integration ensures that all actors involved have access to the same data in real-time, simplifying shared safety management.

## 🌍 International Expansion

Along with the release of the new module, we have extended the platform's language support. Lifts Management is immediately available in 8 languages:

*   🇮🇹 Italian (it-it)
*   🇬🇧 English (en, en-us)
*   🇩🇰 Danish (da-dk)
*   🇩🇪 German (de-de)
*   🇪🇸 Spanish (es-es)
*   🇫🇷 French (fr-fr)
*   🇵🇹 Portuguese (pt-pt)
*   🇸🇪 Swedish (sv-se)

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

The update also includes system optimization interventions:

*   **Data Synchronization**: Implementation of backend logic for secure and selective transfer of data to LIGHT licenses.
*   **Optimized Navigation**: Improvements to menu structure and routes for a better user experience.
*   **Refactoring and Stability**: Code interventions to ensure high performance and correct visual imperfections.
