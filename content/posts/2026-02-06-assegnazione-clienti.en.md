We are happy to announce an update that will make managing your team much simpler and more organized! We have introduced a new way to assign specific customers to your inspectors.

## 🎯 What is it about?

Until now, managing which inspectors should handle which customers could be a bit cumbersome. With this update, we have created a dedicated tool that allows you to say exactly: "This inspector works with these companies".

## ✨ What changes for you?

*   **More Order**: Each inspector will only see the customers and data relevant to them. No more confusion or scrolling through long lists to find what is needed.
*   **Simplified Management**: We have added a new "Manage Companies" window that is easy to use. Select the inspector, check the companies to assign to them, and save. Done!
*   **Security and Privacy**: By ensuring that each inspector only accesses the information of their assigned customers, the system naturally becomes more secure and confidential.

## 🖥️ Where to find it?

You can find this new feature in **Company Settings**, under **User Management**. Look for the new button to assign companies to inspectors!
