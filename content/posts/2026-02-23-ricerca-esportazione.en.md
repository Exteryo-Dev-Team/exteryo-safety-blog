We are constantly working behind the scenes to ensure that every tool on our platform is smooth, reliable, and ready to help you in your daily work. This week we focused on one of the most frequently used features: exporting data to Excel.

We gathered your feedback and looked into some imperfections that were slowing down the experience. Here are the new features we introduced with the latest update!

### 🌍 The right language, always
Have you ever downloaded a report and found the column headers in another language, or worse, read strange technical codes (like `excel.ppe-model`) instead of the real names? We did a major overhaul of our internal vocabulary system. We now guarantee total language coverage across 9 different languages. Whichever Excel report you download, the columns will perfectly speak your language.

### 🎯 Pinpoint precision filters
The goal of an export is to take offline exactly what you are viewing on screen. We have perfected the engine that processes reports: now, when you apply advanced filters or do specific searches on the platform, the generated Excel file will reflect your results with absolute precision, without wasting your time sorting data later.

### 🛡️ Bulletproof downloads (No more "twin" columns)
Sometimes, downloading an Excel file would mysteriously fail. Upon investigating, we discovered that the "culprit" was an identity conflict: in some languages, different terms were translated with the exact same word (for example, two columns both named "Name" or "Email"), confusing the file generator. We solved this puzzle by linguistically differentiating every single field. The result? Goodbye to jams: Excel file generation is now solid, stable, and crash-proof.

**In summary**

Behind this update are thousands of lines of code, but for you it translates into something very simple: fast, reliable, and easy-to-read Excel exports, in whatever language you choose to work with.
